Pantry

This is the core module which manages an entire pantry. It conducts almost all of the backend work required to manage a pantry including some useful search functions.



The pantry is intended to be packaged as a jar file and can be used in a number of bespoke applications. The Pantler web based application uses this package extensively.



Future additions might include creating an Android, iPhone version.
